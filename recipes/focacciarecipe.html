<p>Focaccia is loved by all bread people far and wide!</p>
<p>With so many way to enjoy it, focaccia ends up being a great addition to always have in the kitchen.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>10-12 Servings</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/4oz envelope active dry yeast (approx. 2 1/4 tsp)</li>
<li>2 tsp. honey</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
<li> 5 Cups all-purpose flour (I use Gold Medal brand)</li>
<li> 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) / divided plus more for hands later on</li>
<li> 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
<li> Flaky sea salt</li>
<li>3-5 Garlic cloves</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together your <strong>yeast</strong>, <strong>2 tsp. honey</strong>
     and <strong>2 1/2 cups warm water</strong> in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes (it should start to foam).</li>
    <li>Add <strong>5 cups of all-purpose flour</strong>, <strong>
    <strong>1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt</strong> and mix with a spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks.</strong></li>
    <li>Pour your <strong>4 Tbsp. EVOO</strong> into a bowl that will fit in refrigerator, transfer to dough
into your bowl and turn to coat fully with the <strong>EVOO</strong></li>
    <li>Wrap with plastic wrap or lid and chill dough until it has at least doubled in size, if you're in a rush you can leave at 
        room temperature and it should rise in 3-4 hours.</li>
    <li> Now decide how thick you want your focaccia, for sandwiches I would suggest an 18x13 pan if not a 13x9 will do fine. Coat 
        entire pan generously with butter
, pour an additional <strong>1 Tbsp. EVOO</strong> into center of pan.</li>
    <li>Use two forks to scoop at sides of dough and flip to deflate, do twice and turn bowl 1/4 of the way every 2 flips</li>
    <li>Put dough into your buttered pan and let sit in dry warm spot until dough has again doubled in size
    (on top of pre heating oven works great)</li>
    <li><strong>Pre Heat oven to 450 degrees</strong></li>
    <li> To make sure dough is ready for the oven poke with fingers, it should slowly rise, leaving a small indentation.</li>
    <li> Lightly oil your hands (necessary, if not, dough will stick to fingers)</li>
    <li>Dimple focaccia all over making impressions across entire loaf, do not be gentle with this step!</li>
    <li>At this point you may add any toppings you would like! Sun dried tomatos go great!</li>
    <li> Put pan on middle rack for 20-30 minutes until top of focaccia is a golden brown.</li>
    <li> Melt your additional butter in pan and add your garlic</li>
    <li> Brush your melted garlic-butter to top of focaccia</li>
    <li> Let cool on wire rack and cut into squares and serve!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>You can store focaccia in freezable bags.</strong> When ready to eat again just pre heat oven to 300 degrees and reheat for 10-15 minutes.</p>
